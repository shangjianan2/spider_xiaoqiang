This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

The code that caused this warning is on line 13 of the file /root/biancheng/py/spider/0404/20200402_1/getUrlFromBookHTML.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="html.parser"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.
